description: Procrastination lost to Gatsby and Netlify
---

Hi, my name is Marco and I finally have a blog.

First and foremost, I want to thank [Google Domains](https://domains.google/#/) 
for a cheap and nice domain, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for the 
free hosting, [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for the free 
certificate and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for the free and 
easy blog setup.

As you may notice, I like free and cheap stuff. Maybe that's because
of my ~~poor~~ choice of programming language or maybe it's just my personality.
Bottom line is that Serverless is here to stay. It's powerful, scalable and,
surprise surprise, **cheap**!

[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Bref](https://bref.sh/)
are the primary reason why I wanted
to beat my procrastination and start my blog. I feel like
I have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to write about something
that I have a bit of knowledge in a time where not everyone knows
more than I do. I want to share my experience running
[Laravel](https://https://laravel.com) on AWS and the challenges
of rebuilding a legacy application.

If you have any feedback, questions or suggestions for a topic feel free 
to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deleugyn)
because I don't have a comment section here yet.

Cheers.
