description: I should stop procrastinating and start my blog.
---

After procrastinating for over 1 year I finally decided to setup my own 
blog. Special thanks to [Dave Ceddia](https://daveceddia.com/start-blog-gatsby-netlify/).
I was always lazy to setup my own WordPress, configure it, host it, etc.
Between Google blogspot or WordPress I never felt like making a decision
and taking the first step.  
With Gatsby and Netlify, it looks like my dream to have my own blog
will finally come true.
Hope to finish learning the final details soon so that I can start 
writing. For now you can find some things written on [hackernoon.com/@deleugpn](https://hackernoon.com/@deleugpn).

Cheers.
