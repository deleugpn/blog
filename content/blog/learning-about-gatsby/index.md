After procrastinating for over 1 year I think I finally decided
to setup my own blog. Special thanks to [Dave Ceddia](https://daveceddia.com/start-blog-gatsby-netlify/).
I was always lazy to setup my own WordPress, configure it, host it, etc.
With Gatsby and Netilify, it looks like my wish to start having my own
blog will finally come true.
Hope to finish learning the final details soon so that I can start 
writing. For now you can find some things written on [hackernoon.com/@deleugpn](https://hackernoon.com/@deleugpn).

Cheers.
